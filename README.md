# Rust Audio

This repository contains the code powering https://rust.audio. This website contains information on audio development with the Rust programming language.

## Developing & contributing

Contributions are welcome. This repository uses the [Zola static site generator](https://github.com/getzola/zola). Please check [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) for basic Zola documentation.

### Conventions

When possible, try to content conventions from other items on the site. Most important things should be documented in the `toml` or `md` file. Don't worry too much about getting everything right!

### Site Layout

- About rust.audio is in `content/about.md`
- Formats describing e.g. `VST` vs `CLAP` are in `content/formats.toml`.
- Audio resource links are in `resources.toml`.
